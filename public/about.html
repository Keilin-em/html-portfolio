<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Unafraid to take risks, I love learning and fostering new innovative ideas, especially in a local setting. During summer 2020, I co-founded a marketing consulting company to help small businesses stay afloat during COVID. I am also passionate about mental health and music and hold my Associate Diploma (ARCT) in Violin Performance from the Royal Conservatory of Music.

  I have loved getting involved in the technology space in Canada, starting out as a Partnerships intern with Neo Financial (FinTech, Calgary) and later as a Rotational Product intern with 7shifts (SaaS, Saskatoon). Following that, I was a Jr Product Manager in the ATB 101 program and I am happy to continue my journey in Product. I'm energized by collaboration with teams, love helping others, and have a keen interest in everything Product and strategy.
