<h1>The Best Movies: Keilin's Version</h1>
<h2>Here is a list of my favourite movies I've seen ever</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Sound of Music</h3>
<p>This is a wonderful movie about a singing nun nanny, Maria, who is sent to take care of the Von Trap children in Austria. Little does she know, their father, the Captain is recently widowed but not in fact ready to mingle.</p>

<h3>Anne of Green Gables</h3>
<p>This is a very coming of age movie about the life of a young girl, Anne (with an E), who is adopted by an older family in the countryside. She wants nothing more than to make them proud and happy, although, they thought they were getting a boy. Follow along this wonderful journey full of poems, kindred spirits, friendship, love and more!

<h3>Monster's Inc</h3>
<p>I've always loved movies that create a whole new world full of imaginary everyday things that people do. For example cars, work, ways of life and doing things. That love is definitely fulfilled in Monster's Inc. as we follow the lives of Sulley, Mike Wasowski, and a small girl who escapes one of the "doors". </p>
